## TO DO: the "lat_pt" and "lon_pt" are hard-wired values at the moment --
#   these need to be upgraded to inputs.

# Reads in intermediate cube and plots it.
collate:

  # Make a single NetCDF with all the data inside it.
  - operator: write.write_cube_to_nc
    overwrite: True

  # Plot the data.
