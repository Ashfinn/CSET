title: Domain mean surface $VARNAME time series
description: Plots a time series of the domain mean surface $VARNAME.

# Pre-processing steps.
steps:
  - operator: read.read_cube
    constraint:
      operator: constraints.combine_constraints
      varname_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_var_constraint
        varname: $VARNAME
      cell_methods_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_cell_methods_constraint
        cell_methods: []
      pressure_level_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_pressure_level_constraint
        pressure_levels: []
      validity_time_constraint:
        operator: constraints.generate_time_constraint
        time_start: $VALIDITY_TIME

  - operator: collapse.collapse
    coordinate: [grid_latitude, grid_longitude]
    method: MEAN

  # Save domain meaned variable to a file per validity time.
  - operator: write.write_cube_to_nc
    filename: intermediate/domain_mean

# Collation steps.
# Reads in intermediate cube and plots it.
post-steps:
  - operator: read.read_cube
    filename: intermediate/*.nc

  # Make a single NetCDF with all the data inside it.
  - operator: write.write_cube_to_nc

  # Plot the data.
  - operator: plot.plot_time_series

# To make this recipe a reality:
# TODO: Check filename can contain a directory.
# TODO: Add include file passing in validity time.
# TODO: Implement something to run the post-steps.

# TODO: Retrieve data based on validity time.
# TODO: Cycle on validity time.
