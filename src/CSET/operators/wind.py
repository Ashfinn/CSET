def convert_to_beaufort_scale(
    cubes: iris.cube.Cube | iris.cube.CubeList,
) -> iris.cube.Cube | iris.cube.CubeList:
    r"""Convert windspeed from m/s to the Beaufort Scale.

    Arguments
    ---------
    cubes: iris.cube.Cube | iris.cube.CubeList
        Cubes of windspeed to be converted.
        Required: `wind_speed_at_10m`.

    Returns
    -------
    iris.cube.Cube | iris.cube.CubeList
        Converted windspeed.

    Notes
    -----
    The relationship used to convert the windspeed from m/s to the Beaufort
    Scale is an empirical relationship (e.g., [Beer96]_):

    .. math:: F = (\frac{v}{0.836})^{2/3}

    for F the Beaufort Force, and v the windspeed at 10 m in m/s.

    The Beaufort Scale was devised in 1805 by Rear Admiral Sir Francis Beaufort.
    It is a widely used windscale that categorises the winds into forces and provides
    human-understable names (e.g. gale). The table below shows the Beaufort Scale based
    on the Handbook of Meteorology ([Berryetal45]_).

    The modern names have been used in this table. However, it should be noted
    for historical accuracy that Force 7 was originally "Moderate Gale", Force 8
    was originally "Fresh Gale", Force 10 was originally "Whole Gale", and
    Force 11 was originally "Storm". Force 9 can also be referred to as
    "Severe Gale". Furthermore, it should be noted that there is an extended
    Beaufort Scale, sometimes used for tropical cyclones. Hence, why values
    can reach above 12 in this diagnostic. However, these are not referred to
    in the table as anything above F12 is labelled as Hurricane force.
