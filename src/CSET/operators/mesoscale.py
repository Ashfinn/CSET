    """Calculate a spatial perturbation field.

    Parameters
    ----------
    original_field: iris.cube.Cube | iris.cube.CubeList
        raw original field from the model
    Gaussian_filter: boolean
        Switch to determine if a Gaussian filter is applied.
        If set to True a Gaussian filter is applied; if set to False
        a Uniform filter is applied.
        Default is True.
    filter_scale: int
        Scale at which to apply the filter over in grid boxes. If the
        filter is a Gaussian convultion this value represents the
        halfwidth of the Gaussian kernel.
        Default is 40 grid points.

    Returns
    -------
    An iris cube of the spatial perturbation field, or a CubeList of the
    spatial perturbation fields in the same order they were passed into
    original_field.

    Return type
    -----------
    iris.cube.Cube | iris.cube.CubeList

    Notes
    -----
    In mesoscale meteorology the perturbation field is more important than the
    balanced flows for process understanding. This function is designed
    to create spatial perturbation fields based on smoothing with a Gaussian
    kernel or a Uniform kernel.

    The kernels are defined by the filter_scale, which for mesoscale
    perturbations should be between an approximate cloud separation distance,
    of 30 km, and synoptic scale variations (1000 km). In practice any
    value between these ranges should provided broadly consistent results (e.g.
    [Flacketal2016]_). The Gaussian kernel will give greater importance to
    areas closer to the event and will produce a smooth perturbation field.
    The Uniform kernel will produce a smooth perturbation field but will not
    give local features as much prominence.
