Age of air operator.

The age of air diagnostic provides a qualtitative view of how old air is within
the domain, by calculating a back trajectory at each grid point at each lead time
to determine when air entered through the lateral boundary. This is useful for
diagnosing how quickly air ventilates the domain, depending on its size and the
prevailing meteorology.

The diagnostic uses the u, v and w components of wind, along with geopotential height to
perform the back trajectory. Data is first regridded to 0.5 degrees.

Note: the code here does not consider sub-grid transport, and only uses the postprocessed
velocity fields and geopotential height. Its applicability is for large-scale flow O(1000 km),
and not small scale flow where mixing is likely to play a larger role.
