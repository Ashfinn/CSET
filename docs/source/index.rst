:abbr:`CSET (Acronym meaning contested)` is a tool to aid in verifying and
evaluating :abbr:`ESM (Earth System Model)` configurations. It aims to replace
the :abbr:`RES (Regional Evaluation Suite)`, :abbr:`RMED (Regional Model
Evaluation & Development)` Toolbox and the collections of bespoke scripts
littering people's home directories. By centralising these in CSET the effort
spent on duplicate code can be reduced, and give a chance for code review to
catch any bugs. This will make evaluations more consistent, reproducible and
comparable. For more, see :doc:`/background/why-cset`
