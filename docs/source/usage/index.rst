Installation
------------

The recommended way to install CSET is via conda. It is packaged on
`conda-forge`_ and can be installed with a simple ``conda install -c conda-forge
cset``.

If you instead want to run a development version that has yet to be released,
the easiest way is via an editable install. You can learn how to do this in the
:ref:`working_practices_getting_started` section of the
:doc:`../working-practices/index`.
