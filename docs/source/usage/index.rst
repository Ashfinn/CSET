Installation
------------

The recommended way to install CSET is via conda. It is packaged on
`conda-forge`_ and can be installed with a simple ``conda install -c conda-forge
cset``.

If you instead want to run a development version that has yet to be released,
the easiest way is via an editable install. You can learn how to do this in the
:ref:`working_practices_getting_started` section of the
:doc:`../working-practices/index`.

.. _conda-forge: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/cset

Usage
-----

cset operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The chain of operators can be run with ``cset operators /path/to/recipe.yaml
path/to/input.pp path/to/output.nc``. Additional help is available with the
``--help`` option. The recipe format is described on the :doc:`operator-recipes`
page. If recipe_file is omitted from the command line, the recipe will
be read from the ``CSET_RECIPE`` environment variable instead. This environment
variable should contain the YAML text that you want executed.
