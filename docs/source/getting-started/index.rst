Getting Started
===============

This section contains tutorials suitable for getting started with CSET. By
following them you should learn the basics of using CSET. It is recommended that
you do them in order.

.. note::

    This section details installing a released version of CSET. Developers
    looking to contribute to CSET should see the :doc:`/contributing/index`
    section instead.

There are two ways to run CSET:

* As a command line program
* As a cylc workflow

The command line program is useful for ad-hoc or small scale usage. The cylc
workflow allows large scale processing and parallelisation across compute
clusters, but is more complex to set up and not designed for interactive use.
