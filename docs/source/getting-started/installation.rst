Installation
============

.. Tutorial saying how to install CSET. For edge cases should link elsewhere.

The recommended way to install CSET is via conda. It is packaged on
`conda-forge`_ and can be installed with a simple ``conda create --name=cset
--channel=conda-forge cset``. This will install CSET into its own conda
environment, which is the recommended way to use it, but it is also possible to
install it into an existing environment.

If you instead want to run a development version that has yet to be released,
the easiest way is via an editable install. You can learn how to do this in the
:ref:`working_practices_getting_started` section of the
:doc:`/contributing/index`.
